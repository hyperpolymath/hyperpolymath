== Core Mandate

I architect polyglot systems by prioritising **formal verification** over mere test coverage and enforcing **post-quantum cryptography** as a baseline. My workflow avoids the "convenience code" of bloated ecosystems, preferring verified, aspect-first models.

== The Constellations (439 Repositories)

=== Static Site Generators (51 SSGs)
I maintain an SSG for nearly every viable language to explore compiler boundaries.

=== Gitbot Fleet & MCP Servers
* **Gitbots:** `rhodibot` (RSR compliance), `echidnabot` (fuzzing), `sustainabot` (oikos).
* **MCP:** 10 servers including `poly-proof-mcp` (multi-solver theorem proving).

== Architectural Rigour: The 6SCM Layer

Every repository contains a machine-readable Scheme layer in `.machine_readable/6scm/` to ensure AI agents and human collaborators remain synchronised.

[horizontal]
`STATE.scm`:: Roadmap and blockers.
`META.scm`:: ADRs and architectural rationale.
`AGENTIC.scm`:: AI interaction patterns and safety boundaries.
`NEUROSYM.scm`:: Symbolic reasoning rules.

== Cryptographic Posture (CRYPTO-STANDARD.scm)

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Category | Standard
| PQ Signatures | Dilithium5 (ML-DSA-87)
| PQ Key Exchange | Kyber-1024 (ML-KEM-1024)
| Hashing | BLAKE3 / SHAKE3-256
| Password Hashing | Argon2id (64 MiB, 3 iterations)
|===

== Infrastructure & Automation

All builds utilize `must-just-nickel`. I prioritise `podman` for containerisation and provide comprehensive shell support (from `bash` to `nushell` and `minix shell`) via referenced manifests.
